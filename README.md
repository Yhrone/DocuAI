## Key Components

### Document Processing

DucoAi processes documents through several stages:
1. **Upload & Analysis**: Documents are securely uploaded and analyzed for content and structure
2. **Vectorization**: Key content is converted to vector embeddings for semantic search
3. **Indexing**: Documents are indexed for quick retrieval and cross-referencing

### AI Features

- **Content Generation**: Create high-quality document drafts based on simple prompts
- **Summarization**: Get concise summaries of long documents
- **Semantic Search**: Find relevant documents based on natural language queries
- **Suggestions**: Receive intelligent writing suggestions while editing
